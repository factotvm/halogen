* Knowledge Base (=kb=)

Knowledge Base is a static site generator that exists mostly to allow me to
learn Rust. There are many static site generators out there, you shouldn't use
this one. Perhaps one day that'll change.

But, =kb= is unique in one way---it seeks to elevate Org mode to a position
wherein those that prefer it to Markdown are not left wanting the rich features
that Org mode provides.

Note, however, that currently none of this works, and the first plan is to
leverage existing Rust crates to spit out HTML. The literate programming
functionalities, as well as the ability to render diagrams with tools like
=ditaa= and =PlantUML=, are not present.
